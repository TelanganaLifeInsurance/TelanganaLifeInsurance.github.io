              Life insurance is a contract between a policyholder and an insurance company that provides financial security to a policyholder's family, in case of their demise.
              The policyholder pays "premiums" to the insurer in exchange for a "life cover", also known as "sum assured". This amount is predetermined during the policy purchase
              and is based on the premiums to be paid. Premium payments are made over a period of time called a "policy term," which can be anywhere from two years to several decades.
              It is is important to find a good balance between price and coverage as purchasing too little life cover can affect your family's financial security, in case of your
              accidental death.

            resilent and intelligent inter-process and service communication through <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon">Ribbon</a>.  To provide reliability
            beyond single service calls, <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/hystrix">Hystrix</a> is provided to isolate latency and fault tolerance at runtime. The previous
            libraries and services can be used with any JVM based container.</p>

          <h3>Libraries to help you build rich client applications</h3>
          <p class="lead">Every month, Netflix members around the world discover and watch more than ten billion hours of movies and shows on their TV, mobile
            and desktop devices. Using modern UI technologies like Node.js, React and RxJS, our engineers build rich client applications that run across thousands
            of devices. We strive to create cinematic, immersive experiences that delight our members, exhibit exceptional performance and work flawlessly. We're
            continuously improving the product through data-driven A/B testing that enables us to experiment with novel concepts and understand the value of every
            feature we ship.</p>
          <p class="lead">We created <a href="https://netflix.github.io/falcor">Falcor</a> for efficient data fetching. We help maintain
            <a href="https://github.com/restify/node-restify">Restify</a> to enable us to scale Node.js applications with full observability. We're
            helping to build the next version of <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS">RxJS</a> to improve its performance and debuggability.</p>
